# BUILD REST API WITH AWS API GATEWAY

#### Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a REST API using **AWS API Gateway** and **AWS Lambda**. We will walk you through setting up a basic API that integrates with a Lambda function, demonstrating how these AWS services work together to build scalable and serverless applications. This guide is designed for beginners in AWS cloud computing and covers the essential steps and concepts involved.
#### AWS API Gateway
**AWS API Gateway** is a fully managed service that allows you to create, deploy, and manage APIs at any scale. It serves as a gateway to your backend services, such as AWS Lambda functions or other AWS services. API Gateway handles tasks like request routing, authorization, and API monitoring.

#### AWS Lambda
**AWS Lambda** is a serverless computing service that lets you run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. You can write your code in various programming languages, and Lambda automatically manages the compute resources needed to execute it. In this tutorial, Lambda will be used to process requests coming from API Gateway.

#### Steps to Create a REST API

1. **Create a Lambda Function**: Start by creating a Lambda function in the AWS Management Console. This function will handle the logic for processing API requests.

2. **Set Up API Gateway**: Create a new API in API Gateway. Define the resources and methods for your API and link them to the Lambda function you created.

3. **Deploy the API**: After configuring your API, deploy it to a stage. This makes your API accessible to clients over the internet.

4. **Test Your API**: Use tools such as Postman or curl to send requests to your API endpoint and ensure it is working correctly.

5. **Monitor and Manage**: Utilize CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to monitor your API and Lambda function's performance and handle any issues that arise.
